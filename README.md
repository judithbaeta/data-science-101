# Intro

I enrolled in the [Complete Data Science Bootcamp by 365 Careers](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-data-science-course-complete-data-science-bootcamp) offered on Udemy.com

This is a complete training and it's curriculum includes:
- Mathematics
- Statistics
- Python
- Advanced Statistics in Python
- Machine & Deep Learning

### Motivation
We canâ€™t change what is not measured. However, I recently came across the statistic that 90% of all data has been generated in the last two years, and that Internet users generate 2.5 quintillion bytes of data each day. *This is a lot of data!*

I believe this data can be put to work to help us understand big issues of crucial interest for society. Now, it is time for me to move on to my next challenge and pursue my passion for data as a powerful tool to influence positive change for social impact.

**Here** I want to share some of the practise exercises as well as links to useful resources I have found along the way. 

_**Disclaimer:** The exercises aren't necessarily about topics related to sustainable development as I'm following along the suggested programme of the course. However, this is definitely I'll look to work on in the near future._

# Practical Exercises (so far...)

### Linear Regression
A simple multivariate linear regression model, including oith numerical and categorical variables.
We explore the sales price od second-hand cars.

- Notebook: [Car Sales Price](https://github.com/judithbaeta/data-science-101/blob/master/Car%20Sales%20Price.ipynb)
- Dataset: [1.04. Real-life example.csv](https://github.com/judithbaeta/data-science-101/blob/master/1.04.%20Real-life%20example.csv)

### Logistic Regression 
Built a logistic regression to measure the effectiveness of a marketing campaign of a Portuguese banking institution. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit.

- Notebook: [Bank Marketing Campaign](https://github.com/judithbaeta/data-science-101/blob/master/Bank%20Marketing%20Campaign.ipynb)
- Dataset: [bank-data.csv](https://github.com/judithbaeta/data-science-101/blob/master/Bank-data.csv)

### Cluster Analysis
A market segmentation exercise using cluser analysys with k-means.
We have data from a retail shop. Each observation is a different client and we have a score for their customer satisfaction and brand loyalty.
