# Intro

I enrolled in the Complete Data Science Bootcamp by 365 Careers offered on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-data-science-course-complete-data-science-bootcamp)

This is a complete training and it's curriculum includes:
- Mathematics
- Statistics
- Python
- Advanced Statistics in Python
- Machine & Deep Learning

### Motivation
Now, it is time for me to move on to my next challenge and pursue my passion for data as a powerful tool to influence positive change for social impact.

We canâ€™t change what is not measured. However, I recently came across the statistic that 90% of all data has been generated in the last two years, and that Internet users generate 2.5 quintillion bytes of data each day. *This is a lot of data!*
I believe this data can be put to work to help us understand big issues of crucial interest for society.

**Here** I want to share some of the practise exercises as well as links to useful resources I have found along the way. 

**Disclaimer:** The exercises aren't necessarily about topics related to sustainable development as I'm following along the suggested programme of this course. However, this is definitely I'll look to work on in the near future.
